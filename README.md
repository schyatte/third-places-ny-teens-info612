# Third Places for NY Teens
This repository contains a series of Python notebooks documenting workflows in ArcGIS Pro to import and analyze data about third places for teens in New York City.
The original idea for this project came from conversations and readings I did in another course at Pratt Institute's School of Information, Growing Up Digital. In much of the literature surround teens' technology and social media use, there is a lack of acknlowdgement around the politics of place and agency that affect teens' phone use. If you can't drive, don't have disposable income, and don't want to be stuck in your house, where can you go? Third places (a sociological term used to describe locations of recreation outside of home and work/school) are really important for growing and maintaining social relationships, especially in adolescence. 

This series of workflows and maps gathers data from NYC Open Data and the Census to map potential third places for teens in New York, as well as analyze the relationship between median income and location of those third places.
Lab 1 focuses on geoprocessing -- adding various types of spatial data to a map.
Lab 2 uses spatial statistics to analyze relationships between income and third places. 
Lab 3 is a simple run-down of how to upload a map from ArcGIS Pro (desktop) to ArcGIS Online to create a web map.

These maps, notebooks, and other files were created for INFO 612 Advanced GIS taught by Prof. John Lauermann at Pratt Institute in fall 2025.
